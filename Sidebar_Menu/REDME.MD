# Sidebar Menu Project

This project is a simple responsive sidebar menu created using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. It demonstrates how to implement a sliding sidebar with a toggle button, which allows users to expand or collapse the menu.

## Features

- **Sidebar Navigation**: A sidebar that slides in and out when the menu button is clicked. The sidebar contains links to different sections like Gallery, Shortcuts, Exhibits, Events, Store, Contact, and Feedback.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Each menu item has an associated icon from Font Awesome to enhance the UI/UX.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Social Media Integration**: The sidebar includes social media icons that link to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For the styling and layout.
- **Font Awesome**: For the icons used in the menu and social media links.
- **Google Fonts**: The Poppins font is used for a modern and clean appearance.

## How It Works

- **Toggle Button**: A checkbox input (`#check`) is used to control the visibility of the sidebar. When checked, the sidebar slides in; when unchecked, it slides out.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar has a `logo` section, a `menu` section with various links, and a `social media` section at the bottom.
- **Hover Effects**: The CSS file adds hover effects to the menu items and icons, such as enlarging the icons when hovered.
